# 🗳️ ChainElect — Decentralized Zero-Knowledge Voting System

ChainElect is an end-to-end open-source platform enabling **secure, anonymous, and verifiable voting** using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, **Merkle trees**, and **blockchain** smart contracts.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Traditional voting systems often sacrifice privacy or trust. ChainElect solves this by combining:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (zkSNARKs) to guarantee vote validity without revealing voter identity or vote content
- **Merkle Trees** for efficient and privacy-preserving voter eligibility proofs
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts** to verify proofs and record votes immutably on-chain
- **Web3 Frontend** allowing users to securely connect wallets and cast votes with privacy guarantees
- **Backend Services** to handle proof generation, Merkle tree management, and interactions with circuits

## 📁 Repository Structure

ChainElect is modularized into multiple repositories:

| Repo Name               | Purpose                                       | Link                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `chainelect-zkp`        | Circom circuits, proof generation, verifier contracts | [github.com/ChainElect/chainelect-zkp](https://github.com/ChainElect/chainelect-zkp) |
| `chainelect-backend`    | API server, Merkle tree generation, proof orchestration | [github.com/ChainElect/chainelect-backend](https://github.com/ChainElect/chainelect-backend) |
| `chainelect-frontend`   | React-based Web3 dApp, wallet integration, user interface | [github.com/ChainElect/chainelect-frontend](https://github.com/ChainElect/chainelect-frontend) |

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- npm/yarn
- Circom and SnarkJS installed globally for ZKP repo
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet for frontend
- Ethereum client or testnet access (Sepolia, Goerli, etc.)

---

### Setup

1. Clone desired repos, e.g. `chainelect-zkp`, `chainelect-backend`, and `chainelect-frontend`.
2. Follow each repo’s README for installation and configuration.
3. Run the backend and frontend concurrently to start a full local environment.
4. Deploy verifier contracts on your chosen testnet/mainnet.

---

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Voter Registration:** Backend builds a Merkle tree of eligible voters.
2. **Proof Generation:** Voter uses frontend & backend tools to generate a zero-knowledge proof of vote validity without revealing the vote.
3. **On-chain Verification:** Solidity verifier contract checks the proof and records the vote.
4. **Vote Privacy:** Zero knowledge keeps voter identity and choice confidential while ensuring integrity.
